Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes.
“””Insert text here“””

In the following scenario, you will be given an abstract of a dissertation 
and a proposed title for it. 

The name of the thesis should not only inform the reader about its subject 
matter in a succinct manner but also be engaging. Should the given title 
fall short of these requirements, kindly offer five different 
alternatives.

Abstract: Please input abstract
Title: Please input title

Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes.
“””My Father is Happy“””

Then compare the generated summary to the text delimited with square 
brackets []

[My dad is happy]

Provide a final answer of whether the summary and the [] text are similar 
in meaning.

You will receive two articles (enclosed within HTML div tags) covering the 
same subject. Initially, summarize the main points presented in each 
article. Subsequently, determine which of the two presents a more 
compelling argument and elaborate on your reasoning

<div> insert first article here </div>
<div> insert second article here </div>
