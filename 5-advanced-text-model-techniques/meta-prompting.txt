Create a ChatGPT prompt that would have generated the following code:

# Create a data pipeline of 7 steps from a JSON file to a CSV file, using 
pandas:
import pandas as pd
import json
import openai


openai.api_key = ""


# Extract the reviews from a JSON file
with open("reviews.json") as f:
   reviews = json.load(f)


# Loop over all of the reviews and extract the classification labels using 
the OpenAI API:
for review in reviews:
   # Create the base prompt:
   base_prompt = "You are responsible for classifying text from TripAvisor 
for a restaurant.\nThe possible labels are happy or unhappy.\nBelow you'll 
find an example of the review text and output:\n---\nreviewText: This 
Mexican restaurant is truly a hidden gem. The flavors in every dish were 
so authentic and truly transported me to Mexico. I can‚Äôt wait to go back 
for more!\nlabel: happy\n---"
   response = openai.Completion.create(
   model="text-davinci-003",
   prompt=f"""{base_prompt}\nreviewText: 
{review['reviewText']}\nlabel:""",
   temperature=0.73,
   max_tokens=1339,
   top_p=1,
   frequency_penalty=0,
   presence_penalty=0
   )
   review["classification"] = response.choices[0].text.strip()


# Create a pandas DataFrame from the reviews:
df = pd.DataFrame(reviews)


# Save the DataFrame as a CSV file:
df.to_csv("reviews.csv", index=False)
